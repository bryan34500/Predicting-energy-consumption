# Predicting-energy-consumption

## Problem description

The dataset describes a household's environmental conditions and electricity usage. The data set is a time series with variables representing the internal temperature and humidity monitored by sensors, the electricity usage sourced from the energy meter, and external weather conditions provided by a local weather station. All variables have been summarised into 10-minute intervals over a four-month period. 

## Task

Predicting the electricity usage of the household (the variable named 'Appliances' in the data-set) given the internal and external environmental conditions.
